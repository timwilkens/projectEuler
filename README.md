projectEuler
============

This is a compilation repo of all the various solutions I have for problems on project euler (http://projecteuler.net/),
many of which exist on other repos of mine on github. Some of these solutions were done this week, while others were done
over a year ago when I was just learning to program.

Going forward I will probably put all my solutions directly into this repo.

I have enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy, working on these problems for a couple of reasons:
  * The problems are interesting, and usually require learning some new math along the way.
  * The problems are great for playing with a new language.
  * The problems are great for learning to program in general.
  * Trying to have your solution run in under 60 seconds(as the site suggests) forces you to learn optimization techniques.
